# Kiryana Inventory System - Stage 3 (Microservices Architecture)

## Overview

Stage 3 of the Kiryana Inventory System implements a microservices architecture designed to support thousands of stores with high scalability, reliability, and performance requirements. This stage represents the enterprise-level solution for nationwide store chains.

## Architecture

The system is divided into the following microservices:

1. **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests, handles routing, authentication verification, and load balancing.
2. **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and user/role management.
3. **Product Service**: Handles product catalog management and product-related operations.
4. **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory movements, stock levels, and inventory-related business logic.
5. **Store Service**: Manages store information, settings, and store-specific configurations.
6. **Report Service**: Generates business reports, analytics, and insights.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for service-specific data stores
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs between services
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with Winston
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with orchestration
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests
